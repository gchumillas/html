A partial wrapper for the [V DOM library](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/vlib/js/dom/dom.js.v) that follows V's idiomatic programming style (snake_case for variables and functions, etc.).

## Status

⚠️ **This library is currently in early development phase** ⚠️

This is a work in progress. APIs may change without notice.

## Overview

This library provides a more idiomatic V interface to the DOM manipulation capabilities in the V standard library. It aims to make DOM operations in V more consistent with V's programming style conventions.

## Features

- Follows V's naming conventions (snake_case)
- Provides a more V-idiomatic API for DOM manipulation
- Simplifies common DOM operations

## Installation

```bash
v install html
```

## Usage

fn main() {
    // Example code will be added as the library develops
}
```
